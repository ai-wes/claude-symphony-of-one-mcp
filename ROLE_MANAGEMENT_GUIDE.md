- **`/quick review`** - Code review request (assigns to Senior Developer/QA Engineer)

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### 1. Start the Enhanced CLI

```bash
npm run cli
```

### 2. Join a Collaboration Room

```
ðŸŽ­ > /join development-room-1
```

### 3. Assign Roles to Agents

```
ðŸŽ­ [development-room-1] > /role assign
```

This opens an interactive menu to:

- Select the agent to assign a role to
- Choose role category (Development, Analysis, Management, etc.)
- Pick specific role with description

### 4. Use Quick Assignments

```
ðŸŽ­ [development-room-1] > /quick bug
```

For emergency bug fixes, automatically suggests agents with matching roles.

### 5. Create Tasks from Templates

```
ðŸŽ­ [development-room-1] > /template use CODE_REVIEW
```

Prompts for template variables (e.g., feature name) and suggests appropriate agents.

### 6. Monitor Role Assignments

```
ðŸŽ­ [development-room-1] > /role list
```

Shows all current role assignments with timestamps.

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Features

### Custom Role Creation

```
ðŸŽ­ > /role create
```

Create custom roles with:

- Custom name and description
- Role category selection
- Detailed prompt/instructions
- Capability definitions
- Priority level

### Custom Template Creation

```
ðŸŽ­ > /template create
```

Create reusable task templates with:

- Variable placeholders `{variable_name}`
- Default priorities and assignments
- Checklist items
- Estimated hours

### Role-Based Messaging

```
ðŸŽ­ > /role prompt <agent_id>
```

Send role-specific reminders and instructions to agents.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### Role Assignment Strategy

1. **Assign roles early** - Set roles when agents join rooms
2. **Match expertise to tasks** - Use quick assignments for role-appropriate tasks
3. **Update roles as needed** - Remove/reassign roles when projects change
4. **Use role prompts** - Send reminders about responsibilities

### Task Management

1. **Use templates for consistency** - Standardize common workflows
2. **Leverage quick assignments** - Speed up urgent task delegation
3. **Track role-based assignments** - Monitor workload distribution
4. **Create custom templates** - Build organization-specific workflows

### Collaboration Efficiency

1. **Tab completion** - Learn command shortcuts for faster operation
2. **Interactive menus** - Use arrow keys for quick selection
3. **Command history** - Use UP/DOWN to repeat common commands
4. **Clear role expectations** - Ensure agents understand their assigned roles

## ðŸŽ­ Example Workflow

### Setting Up a Development Team

```bash
# 1. Join the main development room
/join dev-team-alpha

# 2. Assign roles to incoming agents
/role assign
# Select: John -> Development -> Senior Developer
# Select: Sarah -> Development -> Frontend Specialist
# Select: Mike -> Quality -> QA Engineer

# 3. Create an urgent bug fix assignment
/quick bug
# System suggests John (Senior Developer)
# Add details: "Login authentication failure"

# 4. Use template for feature development
/template use FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION
# Enter: feature_name = "User Dashboard"
# System suggests Sarah (Frontend Specialist)

# 5. Monitor team roles and assignments
/role list
/task list
```

### Managing Project Tasks

```bash
# Create a security audit task
/quick security
# Details: "Review payment processing module"

# Use code review template
/template use CODE_REVIEW
# feature_name = "payment integration"
# Assigns to Senior Developer

# Check agent workload
/agents
/role list
```
