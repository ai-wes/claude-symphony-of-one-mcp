# Symphony of One MCP - Multi-Agent Orchestration System

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables multiple Claude instances to collaborate through a centralized hub with shared workspace and real-time communication.

Multiple Claude Code Instances via MCP Servers ‚Üê ‚Üí Collaboration
```

## Components

### 1. Central Hub Server (`server.js`)

- Express + Socket.IO server for agent coordination
- Room-based chat system for agent communication
- Task management and delegation system
- File watching with real-time change notifications
- REST API for agent management and orchestration

### 2. User Orchestrator CLI (`cli.js`)

- Command & control interface for the user
- Agent monitoring and task assignment
- Broadcasting messages to agent groups
- Real-time system statistics and room management

### 3. Claude Agent MCP Server (`mcp-server.js`)

- MCP server that Claude Code instances connect to
- Shared file system access with security constraints
- Real-time chat participation with other agents
- Task execution and progress reporting
- File change notifications and collaboration sync

## Quick Start

### 1. Automated Setup

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies (including sqlite3)
- Create the shared workspace directory
- Test the MCP server
- Show Claude Desktop configuration instructions

> üÜï **New in v2.0**: Enhanced CLI with role management, task templates, and tab completion!

### 2. Start the Central Hub

```bash
npm run server
```

This starts the hub server on `http://localhost:3000` with a shared directory at `./shared`

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file (usually at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-symphony-of-one": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "CHAT_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "SHARED_DIR": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\shared",
        "AGENT_NAME": "Claude-Agent-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace the paths with your actual project location!**

### 4. Start User Orchestrator CLI (Optional)

```bash
npm run cli
```

This opens the orchestrator interface for managing agents and tasks.

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server. You should now see the Symphony of One tools available in Claude.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CHAT_SERVER_URL`: Hub server URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `SHARED_DIR`: Shared workspace directory (default: `./shared`)
- `AGENT_NAME`: Agent display name (default: auto-generated)
- `PORT`: Hub server port (default: `3000`)

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup, see the `claude-config-example.json` file for the exact configuration format.

### Testing the Setup

```bash
npm test
```

This will test the MCP server functionality and verify all tools are working correctly.
